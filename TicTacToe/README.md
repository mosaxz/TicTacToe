*** WAYS TO RECREATE TIC TAC TOE ***
Tic Tac Toe is a incredible game to learn new techniques. 
Is a very simple game, with only few rules and less than 20.000 possible states.
Because of that, you can create this fast, with any style of programming that you want.

For the first version, i started how any project should start: Simple, with the bare minimum to work.
The Minimal Tic Tac Toe is made with Windows Forms, works fine to 2 players and was made in 70 human-made LOC.

I retain no licence-rights about this code and this code can be used anyway you want, but i am not responsible
for any damage caused by misuse of this code.
